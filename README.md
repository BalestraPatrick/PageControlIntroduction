PageControlIntroduction
=======================

This small project is a demo on how to create a pretty nice UIScrollView with paging. I have initially created this as introduction/initial tutorial for my app but I then decided not to include it.
The demo has an horizontal scrollView with 3 pages but the code is almost the same if you want more pages or change it to vertical.
The main features are:
- Background parallax scrolling according to the scrollView offset
- iOS 7 Motion Effects
- ScrollView with paging
- Fade of the previous/next view dynamically according to the scrollView offset
